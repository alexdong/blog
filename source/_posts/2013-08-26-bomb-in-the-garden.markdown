[The bomb in the garden](http://unitscale.com/mb/bomb-in-the-garden/): [Matthew Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com/end-credits.html#bio)'s summarization on the problems of the Internet. It helps me to tie a few thoughts together into a more coherent framework.  The problem statement:"the web is much better at making information free than making it expensive".  As a consequence, "We've ended up with a web dominated by advertising, which is weakening. ". We're seeing "a gradual degradation of design quality" and the real possibility of "the open web becomes a second-class platform".  He did propose a solution, which is similar to what Tim Berners Lee [said](http://www.weforum.org/videos/insight-idea-tim-berners-lee) at World Economic Forum in Jan, that we need to make it really easy to pay for online content.  

[Bootstrap 3 Grid Introduction](http://www.helloerik.com/bootstrap-3-grid-introduction): I found bootstrap v3's "mobile first" approach a bit confusing. This article provides a short-but-solid description on what does it mean to be a "mobile first" grid system.  Even if you were not using bootstrap v3, reading this would still bring a new perspective to stylesheet design in mobile age. 

[Pass: the standard Unix password manager](http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/): A great password manager that follows the Unix philosophy. It uses GPG to encrypt password files and uses git to track password changes. 

[Beautiful Native Libraries](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/8/18/beautiful-native-libraries/): Armin's suggestions on writing proper c/c++ shared libraries that "do not annoy your users". Loads of solid advises, but I hope I would never need to use them.
