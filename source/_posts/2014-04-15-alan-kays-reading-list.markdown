[Alan Kay's reading
list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp). I decided to
read every book on this list. I'm half way through [Mindstorm](http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746) now. Will
publish a book review when I finished it.

> List view is better for phones and smaller tablets because good type design
> implies a single column to achieve adequate font size and line length.
> Designing a magazine or card based grid for larger tablets or desktop is a
> lot of extra work for platforms that are not as rapidly growing in market
> share. We wondered if these grid layouts yield enough marginal performance
> gain on larger screens to offset the cost of building and maintaining them.
>
> A list layout for all screen sizes is beneficial for us due to the dramatic
> simplification of design and engineering problems associated with our layout
> engine and the tangential benefits extending from this simplification. A list
> view is easier to make responsive on all screen sizes and provides a coherent
> experience across web and native apps on all devices.
