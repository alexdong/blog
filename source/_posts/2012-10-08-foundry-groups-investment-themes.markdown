A couple of days ago, I blogged about the[ investment philosophy of USV](http://alexdong.com/union-square-ventures-investment-thesis-explained/) from NYC.   Here is a similar piece from the Colorado based Foundry Group.

[This article explains](http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2008/03/what-is-thematic-investing/) 2 things: "what types of companies do you guys like to invest in? and what sectors do you find interesting?”Here is a quick excerpt:


> Our themes tend to be horizontal in nature and are often based on an underlying protocol, standard or market trend that we believe is on the cusp of widespread adoption that has the potential to drive a cycle of innovation and company creation for at least a five to ten year period. We try to focus on themes and their underlying technologies that are ready to be rolled out to consumers or the enterprise and are well beyond the science-experiment phase.

To make this concrete, some examples of themes we are excited about presently and historically include email, RSS, the implicit web and human-computer interaction (HCI). Because themes are inherently horizontal, they have often have applications in the consumer and enterprise markets and can be delivered in myriad ways, whether it is via a web site, SaaS, a gadget, an appliance or good old-fashioned downloadable client or server software.


Here is a [detailed list of portfolio companies across 6 themes](http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/themes/).
