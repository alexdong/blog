Flurry released a few blogs about mobile app statistics. Here are the ones that interest me the most.

[User loyalty and retention rate per category](http://blog.flurry.com/bid/26376/Mobile-Apps-Models-Money-and-Loyalty). I is the best area to be since users there use the app more often and tend to stick around longer; III sucks as a category.  This provides a very useful way to "benchmark" your app to other similar apps and answer the question: is my average monthly user rate too low or it's just normal.

[Majority of the mobile app revenue comes from premium and in-app-purchase](http://blog.flurry.com/bid/88014/The-Great-Distribution-of-Wealth-Across-iOS-and-Android-Apps).  Clearly advertising revenue makes up small percentage of the revenue. Although it's the "fastest growing revenue category".  You can also see that the size of the app market grows 80% from 5B to an estimated 9B.

[Developer share of Android](http://blog.flurry.com/bid/85911/App-Developers-Signal-Apple-Allegiance-Ahead-of-WWDC-and-Google-I-O) is slowly increasing against iOS. But Apple's iPad is a clearly dominator of the tablet market.

Last but not least, Android is "suffering" seriously from the [platform fragmentation](http://blog.flurry.com/bid/85911/App-Developers-Signal-Apple-Allegiance-Ahead-of-WWDC-and-Google-I-O). Look at how many phones are still running the old gingerbread. It's also worrying that there is no clear leader in the device as well.
