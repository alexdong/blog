Tim O'Reilly linked to Paul Graham's short essay called "[The Top of My Todo List](http://paulgraham.com/todo.html)" today on twitter. I like what PG did to convert the 5 lessons to 5 commands.


> Don't ignore your dreams;

don't work too much;

say what you think;

cultivate friendships;

be happy.
