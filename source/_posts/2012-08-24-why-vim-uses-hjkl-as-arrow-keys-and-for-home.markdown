Stumbled upon [this](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys/) today. Too good not to share it with you guys.

Here is why vim uses hjkl as arrow key. This is the type of [ADM-3a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A) keyboard [Bill Joy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy), the inventor of vi, used when he wrote vi.

Of course, Esc key wasn't so far far away in another Galaxy. Can you find out why the ~ is used in unix to represent the home directory?

You see. Â Nothing happens for no reason but sometime they're just so hidden in the history to be known.
