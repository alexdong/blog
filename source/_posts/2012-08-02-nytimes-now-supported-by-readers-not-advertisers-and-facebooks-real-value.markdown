On July. 26th, 2012, NYTimes announced that it's now "[supported by readers, not advertisers](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/new-york-times-supported-by-readers-not-advertisers.html)". This is a **watershed moment in the history of internet**.  As digital content becomes more and more native in our daily life, people are willing to pay for good contents.


> At the company's big three papers — the _Times_, _International Herald Tribune_, and Boston_ Globe_ — print and digital ad dollars dipped 6.6 percent to $220 million, while circulation revenue was up 8.3 percent to $233 million. **The historical rebalancing**, which occurred at the News Media Group for the first time in Q1, **may indicate a sea change in an industry that has long relied on advertising to stay afloat**. "They're probably the first major paper that has crossed that line," media analyst Ken Doctor of _Newsonomics_ told Daily Intel. "It is an interesting moment."


Almost at the same time, quite a few major internet brands suffer from non-trivial market value evaporation. As written in [Facebook, Groupon, Pandora and Zynga have Drained Almost $50 Billion from Investors](http://www.dailydealmedia.com/789facebook-groupon-pandora-and-zynga-have-drained-almost-50-billion-from-investors/), the author wrote the following about Facebook's performance:


> Soaring from a ridiculously inflated IPO price of $38 tagging $45 before reality set in. After a fantastic earnings report (sarcasm here) shares are trading today at $23.49 down only $ .22 on the day (.91%). That, my friend, is a loss of $34.4 billion in market capitalization or 38.2%. Tally so far – $ 34.4 billion.


I am amused by this stark comparison.  I still believe that Facebook is creating good amount of value, but whether that justifies such a high stock price is probably a different story.  I found the following analysis echoing with my past experience.  It basic posts a good question: [what if social networks value diminishes as the platform starts to monetize it? ](http://powazek.com/posts/3024)


> Every community-based site in the history of the web has essentially been a stab at creating a social network. Most of them fail as businesses, with the rare exception of small, lucky communities that become self-sufficient but not exactly prosperous. What if that’s just the way it is?


If you prefer tables, numbers and a little bit fundamental analysis, this article has laid the most solid, and technical, analysis of the "[real value of facebook](http://www.econmatters.com/2012/05/whats-fair-value-for-facebook-stock.html)".   Based on the size of the advertisement market is "2.1% to 2.3% of nominal GDP" and the numbers disclosed by facebook, the author puts out the following table on projections in 2016.  We'll see.
