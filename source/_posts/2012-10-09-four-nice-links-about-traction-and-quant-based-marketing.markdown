Ran into a few posts about startup traction and the concept of quant based market. Thought it might benefit some readers of this blog. (If you haven't read my previous post of [distribution channels,](http://alexdong.com/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/) you should.)



	
  * Gabriel from DuckDuckGo has two nice articles on this topic.  "[How to move the needle](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html)" talks about traction for different growth period and "[Traction mistakes](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/07/traction-mistakes.html)" lists 4 common mistakes people make. I have all four of them squarely.  This 50% time on product and 50% for traction parallel thinking is certainly the approach I'd take if I have a chance to do it again.   BTW, he is writing a [book](http://tractionbook.com/) on this topic too. His co-author has a [recent review ](http://justinmares.com/thoughts-on-paul-grahams-growth/)on PG's "Startup = Growth" essay which echos what Gabriel has said.

	
  * Noah Kagan who did the original marketing work for mint.com has an interesting post on [Quant Based Marketing](http://okdork.com/2010/07/15/quant-based-marketing-for-pre-launch-start-ups/).  The basic idea is pretty simple. List all potential channels of incoming attention and conversion rate from day-0. Then follow through the list.  Here is the [spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuTYwDzB4XSudGpFcE9lSWI4YzUwcnhKZnNoMktEdkE&hl=en_GB#gid=0)for it. Worth a close look.
