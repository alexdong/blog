I am a firm believer that it is possible to build a startup community where you live.  Especially as the [software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html), I see lots of opportunities when you merge local and mobile together.

Having said this, it won't be easy. There haven't been a clear break-out yet, although New York, Seattle, Boulder are clearly leading the game. I have been consulted on how to do that in our little town Dunedin. I've talked about local capital, proven records, good quality engineers. I have wanted to summarize it into a clearly organized todo list but luckily that has been done by a [very capable VC](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/): [What Makes a Successful Startup Community?
